The PiPedal Client
Copyright (c) Robin E. R. Davies <rerdavies@gmail.com>

Source files in this project are licensed under an MIT license, given below; however
if you publicy distribute derived works from source code in this project, you MUST change the 
name of the program.

Robin E. R. Davies (the Author) explicitly does NOT grant permission
to use the trade names "PiPedal", "PiPedal Client", or similar names in association
with works derived from this work.

The intent of withholding permission is to ensure that the original PiPedal Client 
can be unambiguously distinguished from derived versions of the PiPedal Client, 
most particularly on Google Play, but also on any other distribution channels for 
Android applications. You can't share copies with friends if you don't post your 
modified version on Google Play; but when you do, it absolutely must be distinguishable
from the original

You MAY build programs that derive from the PiPedal Client for private use. And you MAY 
fork the project and make modifications, as long as you don't distribute pre-built version 
of the APK. But if you distribute derived programs in compiled form, you must change the 
name and branding of the program.

Names of the form "Marky Mark's PiPedal Client" are encouranged; but you MUST get 
explicit written permission from the Author before using PiPedal as part of the new name.
Permission will not be unreasonably withheld so long as  what you build can be clearly 
distingushed from the original PiPedal Client.
