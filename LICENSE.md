<i>And whereas the Author wishes to license the PiPedal Remote project under terms similar to an MIT license, save for restrictions on making applications that can be confused with the PiPedal Remote program,</i>

<i>Therefore</i>, the PiPedal Remote Project is made available subject to the following terms and conditions. 

Definitions:

The Author: Robin E. R. Davies, assignees or heirs with whom the copyrights and trademark rights of the PiPedal Remote project currently reside.

1. The Author asserts Trademark protection for the trade names "PiPedal" and "PiPedal Remote", for the PiPedal launcher icon, and the PiPedal logo. You are NOT permitted to make a Derived Work publicly available unless you change the name of the program. The Author also asserts Trademark rights to the launcher icon used by PiPedal Remote, to the PiPedal logo, and asserts all applicable rights to the trade dress images found within the artwork folder of this project that are used to promote PiPedal Remote on Google Play. You may not use these trademarks, icons and images without prior written permission from the Author.

2.  Individual files (the Files) within the project are licensed under an MIT license, given below; however, to the extent permissible by law, the author asserts additional copyright protection on the overall structure and expression of how files within the Project are arranged and assembled in order to create an executable program. You may use individual files found within the Project without being subject to the restrictions of the Project License Agreement; but if you use a substantial portion of the Files within the Project, the terms of the Project License Agreement shall apply in full force and effect. Should this clause be found invalid, the remaining terms of the Project License Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Be advised that Author can and will use DMCA (Digital Millenium Copyright Act) procedures to take down offending Derived Works.
  
3.  The Author grants you permission to created Derived Programs for your own personal use.
  
4.  If you make a Derived Work publicly available, you MUST rename the the Derived Work so that it cannot be confused with the original PiPedal Remote Application, and you must replace Trademark content in the deried work, unless you have obtained prior written permission from the Author.

5.  You are encouraged to use names like "Marky Mark's PiPedal Remote", or "PiPedal Remote McBoatface". Changing the launcher icon color would be deemed sufficient by the Author. And the Author would be amenable to trivial modifications of the PiPedal logo. But if you choose to go this route, you MUST obtain written permission from the Author, before making the Derived Work publicly available. The Author reserves the right to ensure that Derived Works will not be confused with the original PiPedal remote; but such permissions will not be unreasonably withheld. This is intended to be an easy process.
