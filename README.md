PiPedal Remote provides simple one-click access to [PiPedal](https://github.com/rerdavies/pipedal).

Pipedal Remote takes care of the following details when using PiPedal from an Android device:

- Automatic detection of PiPedal servers using DNS/SD service discovery.
- Displaying a web view of PiPedal without wasting space on web browser crhome.
- Remembers your last connection, and auto-connects on launch if the last connection is available.

In conjunction with PiPedal's auto-hotspot feature, this allows you to connect to your Raspberry Pi from your Android device automatically, when you're using PiPedal away from home.
